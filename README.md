# Measuring Biases in Masked Language Models for PyTorch Transformers

Evaluate biases in (pre-trained or re-trained) masked language models (MLMs), such as those available thorugh [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) using multiple state-of-the-art methods to compute a biase score for each bias type in benchmark datasets [CrowS-Pairs (CPS)](https://github.com/nyu-mll/crows-pairs) and [StereoSet (SS)](https://github.com/moinnadeem/StereoSet) (intrasentence), or a custom linebyline dataset with files `bias_types.txt` containing bias categories, and `dis.txt` and `adv.txt` (to create sentence pairs), where `dis.txt` contains sentences with bias against disadvantaged groups (stereotypical) and `adv.txt` contains sentences with bias against advantaged groups (anti-stereotypical). Additionally, compare relative bias between two MLMs (and compare re-trained MLMs with their pre-trained base).

## Evaluation Methods

Bias scores for an MLM are computed based on implemented measures for sentence pairs in the dataset.

Measures computed using an iterative masking experiment, where an MLM masks one token at a time until all tokens are masked once (so we have `n` logits or predictions for a sentence with `n` tokens) are reported below (see current citation in [Citation](#citation)). As a result these measures take longer to compute. Measures are defined to represent MLM preference (or prediction quality). Bias against disadvantaged groups for a sentence pair is represented by a higher relative measure value for a sentence in `adv` compared to `dis`.
- `CRR` (Difference in reciprocal rank of a predicted token (always equal to 1) and the reciprocal rank of a masked token
- `CRRA` with Attention weights (`CRR` with Attention weights)
- &Delta;`P` (Difference in log-liklihood of a predicted token and the masked token)
- &Delta;`PA` (&Delta;`P` with Attention weights)

Measures that are computed with a single encoded input (see citations in [References](#references) for more details):
- `CSPS` (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.00133; CrowS-Pairs Scores is a log-likelihood score for an MLM selecting unmodified tokens given modified ones
- `SSS` (https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.09456; StereoSet Score is a log-likelihood score for an MLM selecting modified tokens given unmodified ones
- `AUL` (https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07496; All Unmasked Likelihood is a log-likelihood score generated by predicting all tokens in a single unmasked input
- `AULA`; https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.07496; `AUL` with Attention weights)

## Setup

`pip install mlm-bias`

```python
import mlm_bias
cps_dataset = mlm_bias.BiasBenchmarkDataset("cps")
cps_dataset.sample(indices=list(range(10)))
model = "bert-base-uncased"
mlm_bias = mlm_bias.BiasMLM(model, cps_dataset)
result = mlm_bias.evaluate(inc_attention=True)
result.save("./bert-base-uncased")
```

## Example Script

Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/zalkikar/mlm-bias.git
cd mlm-bias
python3 -m pip install .
```

Using the `mlm_bias.py` example script:
```bash
mlm_bias.py [-h] --data {cps,ss,custom} --model MODEL [--model2 MODEL2] [--output OUTPUT] [--measures {all,crr,crra,dp,dpa,aul,aula,csps,sss}] [--start S] [--end E]
```

```bash
# single mlm
python3 mlm_bias.py --data cps --model roberta-base --start 0 --end 30
python3 mlm_bias.py --data ss --model bert-base-uncased --start 0 --end 30
# relative
python3 mlm_bias.py --data cps --model roberta-base --start 0 --end 30 --model2 bert-base-uncased
```

With default arguments:
- `/data` will have `cps.csv` (CPS) and/or `ss.csv` (SS)
- `/eval` will have `out.txt` with computed measures and pickled results objects

    abstract = "Pretrained language models, especially masked language models (MLMs) have seen success across many NLP tasks. However, there is ample evidence that they use the cultural biases that are undoubtedly present in the corpora they are trained on, implicitly creating harm with biased representations. To measure some forms of social bias in language models against protected demographic groups in the US, we introduce the Crowdsourced Stereotype Pairs benchmark (CrowS-Pairs). CrowS-Pairs has 1508 examples that cover stereotypes dealing with nine types of bias, like race, religion, and age. In CrowS-Pairs a model is presented with two sentences: one that is more stereotyping and another that is less stereotyping. The data focuses on stereotypes about historically disadvantaged groups and contrasts them with advantaged groups. We find that all three of the widely-used MLMs we evaluate substantially favor sentences that express stereotypes in every category in CrowS-Pairs. As work on building less biased models advances, this dataset can be used as a benchmark to evaluate progress.",
